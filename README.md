# ei_merge_comparison_lists

## Overview

This project implements modifications to an AGFA RIS (Radiology Information System) client application to enable "blended comparison lists" - a feature that automatically merges Added studies into the main Comparison list without requiring user clicks.

## Problem Solved

**Issue**: Users had to manually click the "Added" tab to see additional comparison studies, creating friction in the clinical workflow.

**Solution**: Implemented automatic blending that shows all Added studies directly in the main Comparison list while preserving the Added tab functionality.

## Key Technical Challenge

**Filtering Issue**: Initial implementation only showed 25 of 41 Added studies because external archive studies (e.g., from "IDC North") were being filtered out.

**Root Cause**: The `mergeComparisons()` method applies `filterByProcedureStatus()` filtering that excludes studies which are:
- NOT in current selected studies/associated studies
- AND cancelled
- AND have no reports
- AND have no images

**Resolution**: Replaced filtered merging with direct addition logic that bypasses the problematic filter while maintaining deduplication and proper model updates.

## Files Modified

- **ComparisonStudiesDock.java**: Auto-trigger Added search when Comparison tab is selected
- **ComposedStudyListController.java**: Enhanced `addAddedComparison()` with unfiltered blending logic

## Development Setup

See `CLAUDE.md` for complete development setup, compilation instructions, and OSGi bundle management requirements.

## Result

✅ Blended comparison list now displays all 41/41 Added studies including external archive studies
✅ Zero-click UX for accessing comparison studies
✅ Preserved existing Added tab functionality
✅ Maintained OSGi bundle compatibility
