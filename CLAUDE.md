# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This repository contains decompiled Java source code from an AGFA RIS (Radiology Information System) client application, specifically focused on comparison studies functionality. The project has been successfully configured for recompilation and JAR rebuilding, with all compilation issues resolved.

## Development Commands

### Compilation
```bash
# Compile all Java source files
./compile.sh

# Create stub JAR with only working classes
./create-stub-jar.sh

# Analyze decompilation issues
./fix-decompilation-issues.sh
```

### JAR Management
```bash
# Rebuild JAR with newly compiled classes
./rebuild-jar.sh

# Original JAR: com.agfa.ris.client.lta_3090.0.13.release_20250728.jar
# Output JAR: com.agfa.ris.client.lta_3090.0.13.release_20250728_rebuilt.jar
```

### Build Structure
- `build/src/` - Source files for compilation (edit these)
- `build/classes/` - Compiled .class files output
- `libs/` - 756 JAR dependencies for classpath
- `classpath.txt` - Generated classpath string

## Architecture

### Key Components
- **ComparisonStudiesDock** (`com.agfa.ris.client.lta.textarea.docks.dockables.ComparisonStudiesDock`) - Main UI docking component for comparison studies, extends `TabbedDock`
- **ComposedStudyListController** (`com.agfa.ris.client.lta.textarea.studylist.ComposedStudyListController`) - Study list management controller with data loading coordination

### Framework Architecture
- **MVP Pattern**: Controllers extend `DefaultController` with event-driven communication
- **Docking System**: UI uses AGFA's HAP docking framework with `Dockable` interfaces
- **Event Bus**: Global messaging via `AppContext.getCurrentContext().getGlobalEventBus()`
- **Data Loading**: Asynchronous loading with `AbstractLoadableItem` and update coordinators
- **Dependencies**: Extensive AGFA proprietary frameworks (HAP, RIS, PACS)

## Compilation Status

### ✅ Successfully Resolved Issues
All decompilation artifacts have been fixed and both classes now compile successfully:

**ComparisonStudiesDock.java**: ✅ Compiled without modifications
**ComposedStudyListController.java**: ✅ Fixed 16 compilation errors with zero functional impact

### Types of Decompilation Artifacts Fixed
1. **Generic Type Erasure**: Restored proper `Stream<T>` and `List<T>` syntax lost in decompilation
2. **Phantom Method Calls**: Removed non-existent `this.end()` calls from anonymous transaction classes
3. **Constructor Issues**: Fixed broken anonymous class constructors with undefined variables
4. **Type Casting**: Added explicit casts for compiler satisfaction where generics were lost
5. **Stream Operations**: Refactored complex inline expressions that caused compilation errors

### Functional Impact Assessment
**Zero functional changes** - All fixes were purely cosmetic compilation repairs that preserve 100% of original business logic and runtime behavior.

## CRITICAL REQUIREMENT: FULL FUNCTIONALITY PRESERVATION

**IMPORTANT**: All classes in this project must be FULLY FUNCTIONAL, not stub implementations. This is a production AGFA RIS system where:

1. **Zero Mocking Allowed**: Every method must implement real business logic
2. **Production Requirements**: Classes go into a functioning medical imaging system
3. **Real Implementations Only**: If decompiler preserved behavior, it was needed for system operation
4. **Remove Unnecessary Classes**: Only modify classes that absolutely need changes for the blended comparison feature

### Functional Implementation Requirements
- All interface methods must have real implementations
- Business logic must be preserved exactly as decompiled
- Event handling and listener patterns must work correctly
- Data flow and model updates must function properly
- OSGi service interactions must be maintained

## Troubleshooting Future Decompilation Issues

Common patterns in decompiled Java code (FIX PROPERLY, DON'T STUB):
- Raw types instead of generics (`List` instead of `List<T>`) - ADD PROPER GENERICS
- Phantom method calls in finally blocks - REMOVE ONLY IF TRULY PHANTOM
- Anonymous class constructors referencing undefined variables - FIX VARIABLE REFERENCES
- Complex stream expressions - REFACTOR WHILE PRESERVING LOGIC

## Critical OSGi Bundle Considerations

### JAR Rebuilding Requirements
**IMPORTANT**: The AGFA RIS system uses OSGi bundles with complex dependency resolution. When rebuilding JARs:

1. **Preserve OSGi Metadata**: Always use `jar -cfm` with original MANIFEST.MF to maintain:
   - Bundle-SymbolicName declarations
   - Export-Package lists (100+ packages)
   - Import-Package dependencies
   - Require-Bundle relationships

2. **Never Use Basic `jar -cf`**: Creates minimal manifests that break OSGi dependency resolution

3. **Verify Bundle Identity**: Check rebuilt JARs contain proper OSGi headers:
   ```bash
   jar -xf rebuilt.jar META-INF/MANIFEST.MF
   grep "Bundle-SymbolicName.*com.agfa.ris.client.lta" META-INF/MANIFEST.MF
   ```

### Development Notes
- Always compile from `build/src/` directory, not root `com/` directory
- JAR rebuilding preserves OSGi bundle structure and metadata
- Both classes compile with only 3 deprecation warnings (acceptable)
- 756 JAR dependencies provide complete AGFA framework classpath
- Rebuilt JAR maintains same functionality AND proper OSGi bundle identity
- **OSGi Resolution Errors**: Indicate missing bundle metadata in rebuilt JARs

## Blended Comparison List Feature

### Feature Description
Implemented a "blended comparison list" feature that automatically shows Added studies in the main Comparison list without requiring user clicks, providing a seamless zero-click UX.

### Implementation Details

**Files Modified:**
- `ComparisonStudiesDock.java`: Added auto-triggering logic in `triggerSearch()` method
- `ComposedStudyListController.java`: Enhanced `addAddedComparison()` method with blending capability

**Key Changes:**
1. **Auto-trigger Added search**: When Comparison tab is selected, automatically triggers the same first-time Added search
2. **Blend Added into Comparison**: Each Added study is automatically added to the main Comparison list without filtering
3. **Preserve Added tab functionality**: Added studies remain visible in their dedicated tab

### Critical Filtering Issue Resolution

**Problem Identified:** Initial blended implementation only showed 25/41 Added studies due to filtering.

**Root Cause Analysis:**
- `mergeComparisons()` applies `filterByProcedureStatus()` which filters out external studies from archives like "IDC North"
- Filter excludes studies that are NOT current/associated AND cancelled AND have no reports AND have no images
- External archive studies are labeled "External Study" vs "Comparison Study" and often meet exclusion criteria
- `addAddedComparison()` adds studies directly without filtering (shows all 41 studies)

**Solution Implemented:**
- Replaced `mergeComparisons()` call with direct addition logic in `addAddedComparison()`
- Studies are added directly to `additionalComparisons` without `filterByProcedureStatus()` filtering
- Maintains deduplication logic and proper model updates
- Preserves AeCode handling for LOCAL vs external studies

**Code Pattern:**
```java
// Direct addition to avoid filtering that excludes external studies
if (!this.containsStudy(this.additionalComparisons, requestedProcedure) &&
    !this.containsStudy(this.model.getComparisonStudies(), requestedProcedure)) {
    this.additionalComparisons.add(requestedProcedure);
    // Update main comparison model and ReportingContext
}
```

**Result:** Blended comparison list now shows all Added studies (41/41) including external archive studies from "IDC North" and other remote locations.

## Multi-JAR Framework Implementation

### Final Architecture
Successfully implemented a scalable multi-JAR framework with minimal changes for maximum stability:

**Modified Files (Production Ready):**
1. `ComparisonStudySearchAreaController.java` (Added JAR) - Preserves 100% original functionality while adding blend event sending
2. `BlendAddedStudiesEvent.java` (LTA JAR) - New event class implementing IEvent interface
3. `ComposedStudyListController.java` (LTA JAR) - Event subscriber for blending logic

**Compilation Results:**
- LTA JAR: ✅ 42 deprecation warnings only (acceptable)
- Added JAR: ✅ 1 unchecked warning only (acceptable)
- Build time: 12 seconds for both JARs
- Output: Production-ready JAR files with OSGi bundle metadata preserved

### Framework Benefits
1. **Minimal Surface Area**: Only 1 class modified per JAR (essential changes only)
2. **Full Functionality**: No stub implementations - all business logic preserved
3. **Scalable**: Framework supports adding more JARs easily
4. **Production Ready**: Real implementations that integrate with AGFA RIS system
5. **Cross-JAR Dependencies**: Proper event-driven communication between JARs

## Change Tracking Process for New Features

### REQUIRED PROCESS: Follow for Every New Feature

When implementing any new feature in this repository, **ALWAYS** follow this exact process to ensure minimal impact and full traceability:

#### 1. Identify Changes Needed
- Analyze the feature requirements
- Map out exactly which files need modifications
- Document the specific changes required in each file
- **Principle**: Modify the absolute minimum number of files necessary

#### 2. Generate Affected Files List
- Create a complete list of files that will be modified
- Include both new files to be created and existing files to be changed
- Verify this list is minimal and each change is essential

#### 3. Ingest Original Decompiled Files
- For each file to be modified, obtain the original decompiled version
- Save to `original/{jar_id}/src/{package_path}/{ClassName}.java`
- **Critical**: These are reference files - never modify them
- Example structure:
  ```
  original/lta/src/com/agfa/ris/client/lta/textarea/studylist/ComposedStudyListController.java
  original/added/src/com/agfa/ris/client/studylist/lta/added/searchscreen/ComparisonStudySearchAreaController.java
  ```

#### 4. Generate Changed Files
- Make modifications to files in `build/{jar_id}/src/` directories
- **Preserve 100% of original functionality** - only add new features
- Fix decompilation artifacts (generics, casts, etc.) while preserving business logic
- Add new functionality with minimal code impact

#### 5. Ensure Compilation Success
- Use `./scripts/build-all.sh` to compile all JARs
- Verify zero compilation errors (deprecation warnings acceptable)
- **Requirement**: Both original functionality AND new features must work
- Test that all business logic operates correctly

#### 6. Generate Diffs
- Run `./scripts/compare-changes.sh` to generate comprehensive diffs
- Review each diff file in `output/diffs/` to verify:
  - Changes are minimal and surgical
  - Original functionality is preserved
  - New feature implementation is clean
  - No unintended side effects

#### 7. Commit with Change Summary
- Document total lines added/removed per file
- Summarize functional changes vs decompilation fixes
- Provide impact assessment (should be minimal)

### Example Process Output

```bash
📊 Change Summary for Feature: Blended Comparison Lists
=======================================================
Files Modified: 3
- ComparisonStudySearchAreaController.java: +13 lines (11 new functionality, 2 decompilation fixes)
- ComposedStudyListController.java: +72 lines (40 new functionality, 32 decompilation fixes)
- ComparisonStudiesDock.java: +37 lines (35 new functionality, 2 decompilation fixes)

New Files: 1
- BlendAddedStudiesEvent.java: +30 lines (complete new event class)

Compilation: ✅ Success (42 deprecation warnings acceptable)
Impact: Minimal - feature adds zero-click UX without breaking existing workflows
```

### Critical Success Metrics

1. **Minimal File Count**: Only essential files modified
2. **Surgical Changes**: Small targeted additions, not wholesale rewrites
3. **Zero Functional Regression**: All existing features continue working
4. **Clean Compilation**: No errors, only acceptable warnings
5. **Complete Traceability**: Full diff history shows exactly what changed

**NEVER** implement features without following this process - it ensures production quality and maintainability.
