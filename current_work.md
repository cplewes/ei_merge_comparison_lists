# Blended Comparison Lists - Current Work Summary

## Project Overview

This project implements a "blended comparison list" feature for AGFA RIS (Radiology Information System) that automatically shows Added studies in the main Comparison list without requiring user clicks, providing a seamless zero-click UX.

## Key Files and Architecture

### Primary Modified Files
- `src/lta/java/com/agfa/ris/client/lta/textarea/studylist/ComposedStudyListController.java` - Main study list management controller
- `src/added/java/com/agfa/ris/client/studylist/lta/added/searchscreen/ComparisonStudySearchAreaController.java` - Added studies search controller

### AGFA Framework Architecture (from ei_cache_decompiled analysis)
- **MVP Pattern**: Controllers extend `DefaultController` with event-driven communication
- **Docking System**: UI uses AGFA's HAP docking framework with `Dockable` interfaces
- **Event Bus**: Global messaging via `AppContext.getCurrentContext().getGlobalEventBus()`
- **Data Loading**: Asynchronous loading with `AbstractLoadableItem` and update coordinators
- **OSGi Bundles**: Complex dependency resolution with 756 JAR dependencies

## Core Issues Identified and Resolved

### 1. Performance Issue: Multiple Method Calls
**Problem**: `addAddedComparison` called ~20 times per study due to multiple async callback paths
- External study callbacks
- Local study callbacks
- Direct calls
- Complex EDT task chaining

**Solution**: Simplified `addAddedComparison` from 107 lines to 26 lines
- Removed complex async logic
- Eliminated redundant debug logging
- Single call path per study

### 2. Filtering Issue: External Studies Excluded
**Problem**: Only 43/81 Added studies displayed due to `filterByProcedureStatus` excluding external archive studies
- Filter excludes studies that are NOT current/associated AND cancelled AND have no reports AND have no images
- External archive studies (e.g., "IDC North") often meet exclusion criteria

**Solution**: Added `setAdditionalComparisonsLoaded(true)` to prevent filtering
- Bypasses `filterByProcedureStatus` for blended studies
- All external studies now included

### 3. Persistence Issue: Blended Studies Disappearing
**Problem**: Studies successfully blended but disappeared after `isBlendingActive` became false
- `removeIf` filter in `display()` cleared ALL studies matching active studies
- Including blended studies that should persist

**Solution**: Protected blended studies using `blendedStudyUIDs` tracking
```java
// Before: Cleared all matching studies
this.additionalComparisons.removeIf(s -> this.containsStudy(activeStudies, s));

// After: Only clears non-blended matching studies
this.additionalComparisons.removeIf(s ->
    this.containsStudy(activeStudies, s) && !this.blendedStudyUIDs.contains(s.getStudyUID()));
```

## Key Insights from ei_cache_decompiled Analysis

### AGFA's Original Data Flow
1. `addAddedComparison()` → adds to `addedComparisonStudies` (Added tab only)
2. `mergeComparisons()` → adds to `additionalComparisons` (main comparison list)
3. `display()` → applies `removeIf` filter to clean up old studies

### Anonymous Inner Classes ($1, $2, etc.)
- Normal Java compilation artifacts for anonymous classes
- Contain actual logic for async callbacks and event handlers
- Essential functionality - not bloat

### OSGi Bundle Considerations
- **CRITICAL**: Must preserve OSGi metadata in rebuilt JARs
- Never use basic `jar -cf` - breaks dependency resolution
- Always use `jar -cfm` with original MANIFEST.MF
- 756 JAR dependencies provide complete AGFA framework classpath

## Implementation Approach

### Conservative Strategy
- **Minimal Surface Area**: Modified only essential files
- **Preserve AGFA Architecture**: Work with existing patterns, not against them
- **Surgical Changes**: Small targeted fixes vs wholesale rewrites
- **Full Functionality**: No stub implementations - all business logic preserved

### Multi-JAR Framework
- **LTA JAR**: Main comparison list logic
- **Added JAR**: Added studies search functionality
- **Event-Driven**: Cross-JAR communication via AGFA event bus
- **Production Ready**: Real implementations that integrate with AGFA RIS system

## Code Quality Improvements

### Debug Logging Cleanup
- **Before**: 78 verbose debug logging lines
- **After**: 61 essential debug logging lines
- **Kept**: Error logging and key state transitions
- **Removed**: Verbose trace logging, redundant method calls

### Complexity Reduction
- **Total lines removed**: 120+ lines of complex code
- **Performance**: Eliminated complex EDT task chaining
- **Maintainability**: Clean, readable code that follows AGFA patterns
- **Medical Software**: Preserved essential debugging for regulatory requirements

## Current Status

### ✅ Completed Issues
1. **Performance**: Single call path instead of ~20 calls per study
2. **Filtering**: All 81 Added studies should now display (not just 43)
3. **Persistence**: Blended studies protected from `removeIf` clearing
4. **Compilation**: Both JARs build successfully with no errors
5. **Architecture**: Clean implementation that works with AGFA framework

### Build Results
- **LTA JAR**: ✅ com.agfa.ris.client.lta_3090.0.13.release_20250728_rebuilt.jar (6.1M)
- **Added JAR**: ✅ com.agfa.ris.client.studylist.lta.added_3090.0.13.release_20250728_rebuilt.jar (108K)
- **Compilation**: No errors, only acceptable deprecation warnings
- **Build time**: 12-13 seconds consistently

## Expected User Experience

### Before Implementation
- User must manually click Added tab to see additional studies
- Complex UI workflow with multiple clicks required
- External studies often filtered out (43/81 displayed)
- Performance issues with multiple redundant processing

### After Implementation
- **Zero-click UX**: Added studies automatically appear in main Comparison list
- **Complete data**: All 81 Added studies visible (including external archives)
- **Performance**: Single processing pass per study
- **Reliability**: Studies persist and don't disappear from list

## Technical Validation

### Key Metrics
- **Method complexity**: 107 → 26 lines (76% reduction)
- **Debug verbosity**: 78 → 61 lines (22% reduction)
- **Total code**: 120+ lines removed net
- **Build status**: ✅ Success
- **Architecture**: Maintains AGFA compatibility

### Git Commits
1. **9e07bbc**: Initial simplification of blending implementation
2. **79e8e95**: Fix for blended studies persistence issue

## Future Considerations

### Monitoring
- Watch for performance in production medical imaging environment
- Validate all 81 studies consistently display
- Ensure no regression in existing AGFA functionality

### Potential Enhancements
- Consider user preference toggle for blending on/off
- Add study count indicators in UI
- Optimize memory usage for large patient study sets

## Development Notes

### Tools and Scripts
- `./scripts/build-all.sh` - Multi-JAR compilation pipeline
- `./scripts/compare-changes.sh` - Generate diffs for change tracking
- `classpath.txt` - Generated classpath string for 756 dependencies
- `CLAUDE.md` - Project guidance and compilation instructions

### Critical Requirements
- **Zero Mocking**: Every method must implement real business logic
- **Production Requirements**: Classes go into functioning medical imaging system
- **OSGi Compliance**: Maintain bundle metadata and dependency resolution
- **Medical Software Standards**: Preserve debugging for regulatory compliance
